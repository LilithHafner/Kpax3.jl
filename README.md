# Kpax3 - Bayesian Cluster Analysis of Categorical Data
## About
Kpax3 is a Julia package, written with the purpose of clustering (big) genetic datasets such as DNA/Protein Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA). Kpax3 output consists of a classification of both the rows (statistical units) and columns (statistical variables) of the provided data matrix. It is an improved version of [K-Pax2](https://github.com/alberto-p/kpax2/), based on a novel MCMC algorithm.

## Reference
Kpax3 novel MCMC algorithm has not yet been properly described. To know more about the underlying method and how to properly setup the parameters, refer to the original K-Pax2 paper:

## Download
Kpax3 is currently under development and a stable version is not yet ready.

## Usage
